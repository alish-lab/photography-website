photography-website
This is a simple, responsive photography portfolio website built using HTML and CSS. It showcases a clean image gallery layout designed to highlight photos in an elegant and user-friendly way.

I created this project to combine my interest in design with front-end development skills. Itâ€™s great for personal use or as a base for any visual portfolio.

Feel free to explore, use, or customize it!
